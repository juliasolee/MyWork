## Introduction

My name is Júlia Solé, born and raised in Barcelona :sunny:, where I licensed in Audiovisual Systems Engineering. Until now, I have worked on Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality projects, but lately my passion has been Artificial Intelligence. Let me show you a bit of what I'm talking about.

## Engineering

I'm a **Software Engineer** who loves building VR and AI. In this section you will know more about my academic and professional background.

### Academic background

Last year, I licensed in Audiovisual Systems Engineering (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, UPF) in Barcelona. I was also part of an exchange program at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia. My recent achievement has been to complete a Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity.

In this section are some of the projects I've made related to my career.

#### Computer Graphics
During my Bachelor's degree I have learned about Computer Graphics in several courses, theoretically from the bases, mathematically and practically. The programming language was C++ for all of them and you can find them at my [Computer Graphic section](https://github.com/juliasolee/MyWork/tree/master/ComputerGraphics).

#### Game Development
Some of the projects that have taken my C and C++ skills to the next level have been Game Development projects. In them, I have advanced my programming skills, creativity and problem-solving.

You can find all the Game Development projects that I have made in my [Videogames section](https://github.com/juliasolee/MyWork/tree/master/Videogames).

#### Artificial Intelligence
In my bachelor's degree I did different projects on machine learning. But it wasn't until I finished my degree that I decided to enter into the world of artificial intelligence and to do the Deep Learning Nanodegree. In this course I have been able to learn about different algorithms and Deep Learning models, and put them into practice with different real-based projects and datasets.

You can find all my projects from the Deep Learning Nanodegree in my [Artificial Intelligence section](https://github.com/juliasolee/MyWork/tree/master/ArtificialIntelligence).
