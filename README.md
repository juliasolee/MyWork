## Introduction

My name is Júlia Solé, I'm living in Barcelona, where I licensed in Audiovisual Systems Engineering (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, UPF). Until now, I have worked on Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality projects, but lately my passion has been Artificial Intelligence. Let me show you a bit of what I'm talking about.

## Engineering

I'm a **Software Engineer** who loves building VR and AI. I recently worked on a project about integrating e-commerce in a VR entertainment inflight platform. After graduating from an engineering degree, I expanded my knowledge in AI with a Deep Learning Nanodegree.

### Academic background

Last year, I licensed in Audiovisual Systems Engineering (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, UPF) in Barcelona. I was also part of an exchange program at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia. My recent achievement has been to complete a Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity.

In this section are some of the projects I've made related to my career.

#### Computer Graphics

During my Bachelor's degree I have learned about Computer Graphics in several courses, theoretically from the bases, mathematically and practically. The programming language was C++ for all of them and you can find them at my [Computer Graphics Section](https://github.com/juliasolee/MyWork/tree/master/ComputerGraphics).
